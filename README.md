# bootstrap

I made a website for a Black and White movie festival with the UI framework Bootstrap. \
Its the first time using bootstrap so here are my thoughts:

> **Good**
> + Bootstrap made it easy to make responsive design 
> + Bootstrap has great reusable elemets like the carousel, buttons, navbar, cards and table.
> + Bootstrap is great for making quick simple design templates

> **Bad**
> + Bootstrap made it difficult to change elements to your own liking.
> + Bootstrap is widely used and therefore the design becomes unoriginal.

## Usage

Clone this project and open up the [index.html](index.html) to view the html for the front page. \
Open up the [schedule.html](schedule.html) to view the html for the schedule page. \

Styles where made with [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) \
All additional styles are in [styles.css](styles.css). \

## Demo

Go to [B&w Film Festival](http://bandwfilmfestival.surge.sh/) or http://bandwfilmfestival.surge.sh/  to view a demo of the page\.
